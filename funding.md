# Funding!
*Where does your paycheck come from? Who’s responsible for deciding how it’s spent?*

## Overview
This document covers where the History department gets its funding, specifically the funding that ultimately finds its way into our (that is, graduate workers’) pockets as paychecks, tuition remission, fringe benefits, and grants. Where your money comes from can (usually) be sussed out from how you get it; for instance, teaching assistant paychecks come from the university’s general funds, while those of us on fellowship are funded by a block grant from the graduate school that ultimately originates from WARF[^2]. The path your money takes to your pocket is important for figuring out *who* has the power to change it—department admin? faculty shared governance organs? campus-wide institutions?

* **WARF (Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation)**: While instructional labor is generally funded from the university’s general operating expenses, much of our other funding comes from WARF. WARF is like the technology transfer offices at other universities, in that they hold UW’s patents and manage the income from licensing them, with the exception that they are incorporated separately from the UW system. This gives WARF funding some insulation from state politics and UW enrollment numbers, but also provides an additional degree of bureaucratic separation when it comes to negotiating with the people who pay us.
* **(O)VCRGE ((Office of the) Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education)**: Pronounced “Vee-Surge,” this office does a lot; for our present purposes, the important thing they do is administer and disburse the grants coming from WARF to fund both graduate fellowships and, through faculty research, graduate PAships.
* **L&S (College of Letters and Sciences)**: This is the key *teaching* unit for our present purposes here: the department’s direct report when it comes to Teaching Assistanceships and other instructional matters.

## Funding sources/mechanisms

### Teaching Assistanceships
*(If you are an instructor of record this may be different; if you are teaching a summer class this is **definitely** different)*

The university may, publically, play down the importance of teaching assistants’ labor, but internally acknowledges our revenue generating role in at least one key arrangement: the money to pay teaching assistants during the academic year comes from the unvisity’s **general funds** which are also called **101 funds**. As they set their teaching plan, departments request a certain number of TA lines from the university, which the university (hopefully) funds directly from tuition, state funding, and its other general revenue sources. For reasons we will discuss later, this means that TA pay and benefits are more vulnerable to the varagies of state politics and funding cycles than other employment types. The university has recently made efforts to make funding levels roughly equivalent for different graduate funding mechanisms, so there is not necessarily a 1:1 correspondence between what happens in the Capitol and what TAs are paid. As of this writing, for instance, it’s not clear how the state legislature’s (fall 2023) attempts to block UW system employees from their pay raise will affect TA pay. 

If the department still determines on its own the FTE percentage that a TAship represents, one potential lever to pull would be adjusting not our hourly rate, but the number of hours a given TAship represents. If we were expected to put, say 24 hr/wk (rather than 20) into a given TAship, our FTE would be 60% rather than 50%, which could represent effectively a 20% raise. 

### Fellowships
Fellowships are key to a History graduate student’s career: for pre-dissertators, fellowships enable us to focus on our classes; for dissertators, they enable us to research and write without being bound to living and working in Madison. Most history grads’ fellowships are funded through a block grant that WARF[^2] gives the university each year. OVCRGE[^1] then determines how the grant is divvied up between departments. The grants aren’t enumerated in terms of history 

The timeline is interesting here: WARF tells VCRGE how big, in dollar terms, each academic year’s grant is going to be *two* years before said academic year. So this amount is set *before* any pay raises for graduate workers are decided. During the October prior to the relevant academic year, all the graduate programs (including both History and HSMT, separately) apply for their block grant from WARF. If a pay raise is coming for graduate students, well, the size of WARF grant is already set, so in terms of *student-semesters of funding* VCRGE is divvying up a smaller pie. 

VCRGE then decides how many pre-dissertator and dissertator semesters of support each program will get. Importantly, programs are granted *semesters of support* rather than *dollars*. This means that if seg fees, tuition, or pay are raised, fellowships will continue to cover them, but it also means that the VCRGE block grant funding cannot be used for anything other than this immediate funding. If we want the department to cover things that VCRGE block grant money can’t, we may need to look beyond this funding source. 

Because History is one of the biggest departments, especially among those (usually social science/humanities) that *do not* typically pay their students off grant funding from sources like the NSF and NIH, we may represent one of the largest such grants from OVCRGE. 

### PAships

Most *research* PAships are also funded by WARF funding passed through OVCRGE, but in a slightly different way. This money is actually granted to *faculty* who apply in an annual competition for research funds. In this competition, priority is given to applications that would be paying a graduate assistant. However, despite being funded through OVCRGE using WARF funding, PAs usually find their employment situation is more similar to TAs than to fellows; they are on the hook for segregated fees, they are owe FICA tax on their payment, etc.

### Gift Funds
Most history graduates’s fellowships are funded through these block grants from VCRGE to History or HSMT, but if the program wants to admit more students than the VCRGE grant allows, they can often cover this with gift funds. Gift funds are also used to cover other payments that the History department decides are in students’ interest: for instance, research and conference travel funding, the $2,000 summer funds we’ve been getting, etc. 

Gift funds are administered by WARF, but are a separate pot of money, sometimes with specific restrictions: a given fund might, for instance, cover research and instruction in a given region or period; any faculty or graduate hired with those funds, or any activity funded, would then have to be relevant to that research. 

Other gift funds, though, can be sources of significant flexibility. If an entering class has a low yield rate, resulting in fewer incoming students than expected the department will try to fund as little of that as possible through gift funds, so that they can roll them over and use them to fund a class with an unexpectedly high yield. Gift funds can also cover unforseen needs; if another funding source falls through at the last minute, the department may draw on gift funds to meet its funding obligations to the student. Given this flexibility, they may be a good focus for organizing for department-level financial goals. **However, neither faculty nor graduates students have much visibility into how these funds are managed, so more mapping is needed there.**

## Current questions
*If you know the answer to any of these, you could make a pull request, but you could also contact us at [wisc.hist.taa@gmail.com](mailto:wisc.hist.taa@gmail.com) and we will either add you as a collaborator to this wiki or add the information you provide!*
  * **What’s the relationship between VCRGE and the Graduate School?** VCRGE handles research generally, not just grad research. Is one subsumed by the other?
  * **How does TA funding get set?** The department used to set for itself the FTE percentage that TAs were given (for most of us this is 50%) but we’re not sure if this is still the case.
  * **How profitable are summer courses for the department? Where does that money go?** We could presumably get a ballpark guess for this by multiplying enrollment by credit hours, but we’d need to confirm what percent of that revenue goes to the department.
  * **How are non-research-assistant PAships funded?**
  * **What gift funds are available? What are they used for—and how could it be otherwise?**
