# Funding!
*Where does your paycheck come from? Who’s responsible for deciding how it’s spent?*

## Overview
This document covers where the History department gets its funding, specifically the funding that ultimately finds its way into our (that is, graduate workers’) pockets as paychecks, tuition remission, fringe benefits, and grants. Where your money comes from can (usually) be sussed out from how you get it; for instance, teaching assistant paychecks come from the university’s general funds, while those of us on fellowship are funded by a block grant from the graduate school that ultimately originates from WARF[^2]. The path your money takes to your pocket is important for figuring out *who* has the power to change it—department admin? faculty shared governance organs? campus-wide institutions?. 

## Key organizations/Abbreviations
* **Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF)**: While instructional labor is generally funded from the university’s general operating expenses, much of our other funding comes from WARF. WARF is like the technology transfer offices at other universities, in that they hold UW’s patents and manage the income from licensing them, with the exception that they are incorporated separately from the UW system. This gives WARF funding some insulation from state politics and UW enrollment numbers, but also provides an additional degree of bureaucratic separation when it comes to negotiating with the people who pay us.
* **Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education (VCRGE)**: Pronounced “Vee-Surge,” this office 

## Teaching Assistanceships
*(If you are an instructor of record this may be different; if you are teaching a summer class this is **definitely** different)*

The university may, publically, play down the importance of teaching assistants’ labor, but internally acknowledges our revenue generating role in at least one key arrangement: the money to pay teaching assistants during the academic year comes from the unvisity’s **general funds** which are also called **101 funds**. As they set their teaching plan, departments request a certain number of TA lines from the university, which the university (hopefully) funds directly from tuition, state funding, and its other general revenue sources. For reasons we will discuss later, this means that TA pay and benefits are more vulnerable to the varagies of state politics and funding cycles than other employment types. The university has recently made efforts to make funding levels roughly equivalent for different graduate funding mechanisms, so there is not necessarily a 1:1 correspondence between what happens in the Capitol and what TAs are paid. As of this writing, for instance, it’s not clear how the state legislature’s (fall 2023) attempts to block UW system employees from their pay raise will affect TA pay. 

## Fellowships
Fellowships are key to a History graduate student’s career: for pre-dissertators, fellowships enable us to focus on our classes; for dissertators, they enable us to research and write without being bound to living and working in Madison. Most fellowships are funded by an annual block grant 

## Current questions
*If you know the answer to any of these, you could make a pull request, but you could also contact us at [wisc.hist.taa@gmail.com](mailto:wisc.hist.taa@gmail.com) and we will either add you as a collaborator to this wiki or add the information you provide!*
  * **What’s the relationship between VCRGE and the Graduate School?** VCRGE handles research generally, not just grad research. Is one subsumed by the other?
  * **How does TA funding get set?** The department used to set for itself the FTE percentage that TAs were given (for most of us this is 50%) but we’re not sure if this is still the case.
  * **How profitable are summer courses for the department? Where does that money go?** We could presumably get a ballpark guess for this by multiplying enrollment by credit hours, but we’d need to confirm what percent of that revenue goes to the department.
  * **How are non-research-assistant PAships funded?**

The there are two primary and two secondary sources that matter most for this. Most of our money comes from (1) **employment as instructors** (funded at root by the unviersity’s general operating expenses, or “101 funds”, though ) and (2) **fellowships** (funded by a block grant from OVCRGE[^1]). Sometimes, we get **PAships**; PAships dedicated to assisting individual faculty members are also funded by OVCRGE, but through competitive grants to individual faculty members. Finally
