# Funding!
*Where does your paycheck come from? Who’s responsible for deciding how it’s spent?*

## Overview
This document covers where the History department gets its funding, specifically the funding that ultimately finds its way into our (that is, graduate workers’) pockets as paychecks, tuition remission, fringe benefits, and grants. Where your money comes from can (usually) be sussed out from how you get it; for instance, teaching assistant paychecks come from the university’s general funds, while those of us on fellowship are funded by a block grant from the graduate school that ultimately originates from WARF[^2]. The path your money takes to your pocket is important for figuring out *who* has the power to change it—department admin? faculty shared governance organs? campus-wide institutions?. 

## Teaching Assistanceships
*(If you are an instructor of record this may be different; if you are teaching a summer class this is **definitely** different)*

The university may, publically, play down the importance of teaching assistants’ labor, but internally acknowledges our revenue generating role in at least one key arrangement: the money to pay teaching assistants during the academic year comes from the unvisity’s **general funds** which are also called **101 funds**. As they set their teaching plan, departments request a certain number of TA lines from the university, which the university (hopefully) funds directly from tuition, state funding, and its other general revenue sources. For reasons we will discuss later, this means that TA pay and benefits are more vulnerable to the varagies of state politics and funding cycles than other employment types. The university has recently made efforts to make funding levels roughly equivalent for different graduate funding mechanisms, so there is not necessarily a 1:1 correspondence between what happens in the Capitol and what TAs are paid. As of this writing, for instance, it’s not clear how the state legislature’s attempts to block UW system employees from their pay raise will affect TA pay.  

The there are two primary and two secondary sources that matter most for this. Most of our money comes from (1) **employment as instructors** (funded at root by the unviersity’s general operating expenses, or “101 funds”, though ) and (2) **fellowships** (funded by a block grant from OVCRGE[^1]). Sometimes, we get **PAships**; PAships dedicated to assisting individual faculty members are also funded by OVCRGE, but through competitive grants to individual faculty members. Finally
